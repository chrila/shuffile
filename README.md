shuffile
========

Shuffile is a tool to shuffle and organize files inside a directory (e.g. for music on a USB drive). I made it because I play music from a USB drive in my car which doesn't support shuffling, so i shuffle the files instead (by inserting prefixes in the file names).

Additionally, shuffile can create sub-folders where the randomized files will
be moved. This is also based on a requirement, because my car radio can only
play the first 99 files of a directory.

The coding is done using C++ and Qt 4.8.
